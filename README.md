COVID-19 Data Analysis

    This project is a data exploration and visualization of COVID-19 statistics focused on Asian countries. It uses the OWID COVID-19 dataset to uncover patterns in total cases, death rates, and vaccination rates.

Objectives:

    Analyze the spread and impact of COVID-19 across Asian nations.

    Calculate death rates and vaccination percentages.

    Compare trends across selected countries.

    Visualize data using interactive and geographic plots.

    Identify anomalies and gain insights through visual exploration.

Tools and Libraries Used:

    Python 3.x

    Jupyter Notebook

    Pandas – for data wrangling

    Matplotlib – for static plots

    Plotly Express – for interactive visualizations

    GeoPandas – for geographic mapping

    OWID COVID-19 Dataset – source data from Our World in Data

How to Run the Project:

    Clone the repo:
    git clone https://github.com/Danchi-1/COVID_data_analysis.git
    cd COVID-data_analysis

    Create and activate a virtual environment:
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    Install dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Launch the notebook:
    jupyter notebook

    Open and run: covid_analysis.ipynb

Key Insights:

    India and Indonesia recorded the highest number of total cases among Asian countries.

    Bhutan and Singapore had among the fastest and most successful vaccine rollouts.

    Death rates varied significantly across countries, with some showing extremely low reported fatalities, possibly due to underreporting or effective containment strategies.

    Several countries had large data gaps, particularly in vaccination statistics, highlighting differences in infrastructure and transparency.

Reflections:

    Working on this project gave me deeper insight into pandemic data analysis. It challenged me to clean real-world datasets, generate new metrics like death rates and     vaccination percentages, and create powerful visualizations using Python. I also got hands-on with tools like Plotly and GeoPandas to turn raw data into interactive, meaningful stories.
